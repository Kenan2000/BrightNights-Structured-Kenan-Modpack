# Modpack UPDATE Guide

2. Repeat all steps from the INSTALLATION guide
3. You're all set!

# FAQ:

* Q: Why should I remove manually some specific non-mainlined mods when updating?
  * A: Because sometimes some mod files become obsolete and no longer used, so you won't need them inside your mods folder anymore, so for dealing with these problems you need to delete the mod and fully reinstall it.

* Q: After updating my save file no longer loading!
  * A: It is rare, but will happen when some mod that've been used in your save has new ID and/or name, or you're trying to load the mod that is no longer used/merged with other one. You can fix it by reading `debug.log` to view what's mod should be changed, then go to `cdda\save\world_name\mods.json` and replace target mod ID with the new one, or delete it's entry from this file if there is no replacement. Also, you can read latest commits to see what is happening, if you want
