# Wild-Living
A mod to bring a little more life and variety to the wilds of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

Intended for 'InnaWoods' playthroughs, this mod adds a content centered around living in the woods and swamps without access to modern technology. Where possible, historical methods are provided for various things that currently require modern tools, some concessions are made to gameplay balance.

## Features

Overview:
- Low-tech tools that don't require a full smithing setup
- Fur clothing
- More food preservation options
- More materials made from scratch

## Tools

### Bone Pickaxe
A low quality pickaxe, good for breaking up those larger boulders in the fields for rocks.

### Flint Hand Drill
A simple bow drill, except instead of making fires, the rod is fitted with a knapped stone blade to drill into wood, useful to get maple sap before you have a full forge setup.

### Wooden Fish Trap
A fish trap based on the same principle as the plastic fish trap, but made from cordage and sticks. Still needs fish bait.

### Wooden Dog Whistle
Got yourself a pack of labradors to do your bidding but can't control the wilful pups? Carve yourself a whistle from some spare wood to command your faithful companions.

### Natural cordage screwdriver
Add a simple recipe for a screwdriver using a chunk of steel, hammering and natural cordage for a handle grip.

### Oilcloth Tent
Can't find tent kits and want an upgrade from the fur shelter kit? Try making Oilcloth!

## Materials

### Oilcloth
Combining Turpentine and Oil with a bit of Charcoal, you can make waterproofed cloth suitiable for tent material.

## Clothing

### Fur Backpack
A fairly sizable backpack (20L) that includes a tool loop for an stone axe or similar, albeit with a higher encumbrance.

### Fur Pelt Tanning
For the survivor down on their luck for finding a source of salt, fur pelts can be tanned with eggs or slurried brain, Get yourself warm and toasty with fur clothing.

## Food & Food Preservation

### Tea Bags
Dry out tea components and store them in tea bags, a convenient way to put aside various herbal rememdys for long term storage, steep in hot water and enjoy. Also a new tea, dandelion root.

### Cattail Rhizome processing
Shred cattail rhizomes into water to create starch rich water for drying out with a evaporation bowl unattended or further process the starch paste into dried flakes for milling either by hand or with an unattended mill.

### Harvestable Acorns
Harvest acorrns from oak trees in autumn, boil the acorns to blanch them then grind up with a food processor, clay/rock quern or a mortar and pestle to make corn meal.

### Salt & Starch Extraction
Use a large shallow Clay Evaporation Dish and a smoking rack to evaporate the water out of starch solution and salt water, craft the filled evaporator dish recipe with the desired material then simply set the dish into a smoking rack for a few hours, then craft the dish into the desired product and get the evaporation bowl back.	

### Digestive Tracts
When butchering an animal, you remove the entire digestive tract and seemingly discard everything but the stomach, this adds the intestines back in and adds two new options for preservation

- Salted & Dried Rennet
- Salted & Dried Meat Casings

Butcher a creature for it's digestive tract, then use the new 'Cleaned Intestines' recipe under Other -> Materials to use boiled water to clean out the digestive tract, in return you get Cleaned Intestines and a Cleaned Stomach. 
The intestines can be further salted and dried over a fire to produce Meat Casings, which are a long lasting resource for making sausages. The stomach itself, now cleaned, can be used for anything a regular stomach would be a component in, or it can be processed further with salt, heat and time into Rennet, which can be kept aside later for making curdled milk.

All the relevant stomach using recipes have been changed to accept the cleaned versions, or rennet, or meat casings, where appropriate.

Both Rennet and Meat Casings are essentially dried out and salted for maximum storage and will last about 2 years in ideal conditions.
Recipe variants exist for Large Digestive tracts, currently there isn't any additional processing for human stomachs.

## Early Game Help

For the survivor starting on a Naked And Afraid or Shower Victim wilderness runs, the Birch Jug and Birch Funnel might save you from a quick death by dehydration. A little bit of cordage and a few sheets of birchbark from a nearby birch tree and you'll be drinking rainwater in no time, though it's recommend to still boil it first.

## More Cordage

You can never have enough ways to tie things together in the wilds, and now you can process the fibrous inner layers of willow bark for cordage ropes, harvest willow reeds from willow trees then strip the bark to get the willow bark.

## Clay Changes
Large clay vessels can now use either Leather Cordage or Rough Cordage for the straps rather than consuming leather/fur patches. Large Clay Container can use either hide or birchbark to waterproof the lid, requires some kind of adhesive to glue the waterproofing on.

## Constructables

### Wooden Work Mat
When butchering, you really want a flat surface to work on, this simple wooden workmat is a rolled up collection of long sticks bound together with cordage, create a flat draining surface you can wipe clean after use.

### Makeshift Fence
A simple fence made from 2x4's and sticks, more a suggestion of a barrier, but will keep small animals contained, you hope.

### Woven Fence
An even simpler fence made from a few supporting sticks and woven long sticks, provides the suggestion of a barrier but should keep small livestock contained.

### Plantable Fruit + Coffee Trees
The fruit trees can have cuttings taken from them, the cutting planted up in a clay planting pot for two weeks then finally replanted as a fruit tree in a place of your choosing, harvest the year after, or take more cuttings to increase your orchard size.
