    "description": "Before the Cataclysm a loose collection of drifters, hobos, addicts, and other homeless people took shelter in the abandoned tunnels beneath New England, largely ignored by the authorities and townsfolk.  Their hidden sanctuary allowed them to survive the first wave of horrors, but not unscathed.  Many of them have begun to show signs of change, biological adaptions to their new underground home.  Despite their weird appearance and reclusive nature, the Morlocks are friendly to those surface-dwellers willing to trade."
