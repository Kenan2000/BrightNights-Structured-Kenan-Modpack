I almost thought it was some kind of morbid live action role playing during the riots, until one of them looked directly at me.  I swear its eyes pulsed red, and I started having the worst panic attack I've ever had, it was as if the knight turned into a crusading Templar and I was a refugee outside the walls of Jerusalem.  If I hadn't already had an empty stomach I probably would have lost it.  It still haunts me.",

Just when they seemed like they were about to strike, I must have came to my senses because I was on the floor of the bus dry heaving.",
