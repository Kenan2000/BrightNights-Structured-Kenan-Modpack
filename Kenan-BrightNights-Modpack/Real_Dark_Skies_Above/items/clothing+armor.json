There are very faintly visible alien hieroglyphs scattered across the armor.  There isn't anything to stop you from trying it on for size if you wanted to.",

There is also a vent-like grid on the lower part which allows air to pass.  The various straps on the back can be adjusted which in turn changes the size and shape of the mask itself, twisting the face into new and uniquely monstrous expressions.",
