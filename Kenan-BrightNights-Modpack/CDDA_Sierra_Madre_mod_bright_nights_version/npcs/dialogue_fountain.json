Also don't waste your bullets - they are simply invincible and the only way to destroy them is to find their corresponding emitters and switch them off. There are also hologram vendors you can trade with, but they're based on pre-war currency, so I wouldn't count much on resupplying this way. However, the entire villa is filled with loot from previous survivors. Also the local vending machines still seem to be working. Using Sierra Madre Casino chips you can easily find in most streets and buildings of the villa you can purchase food from them, and if you find the correct code cards, they'll also unlock military and medical supplies for sale.
