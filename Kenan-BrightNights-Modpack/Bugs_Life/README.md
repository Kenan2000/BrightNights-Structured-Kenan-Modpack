# Bugs_life
Mod for CDDA. It adds new kinds of mutated insects and more.

Monsters:

-Aphids

-Praying mantises in three sizes

-Underground mole crickets

-Lady bugs

-Grasshoppers in two sizes

-Antlion larvae and adult antlions

-Water striders in two sizes

Aphids and ladybugs are most commonly found near anthills. Aphids can be tamed using cattle fodder, similar to a cow. You don't have to "milk" your new friends, rather wait for it to poop sugary honeydew.

You can extract sugar from honeydew at app. science lvl 4.
