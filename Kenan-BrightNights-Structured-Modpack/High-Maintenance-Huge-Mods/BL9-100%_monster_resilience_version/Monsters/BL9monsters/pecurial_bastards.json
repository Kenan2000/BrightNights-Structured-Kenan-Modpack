    "description": "Shapeshifting, energized, formless grotesque creature that takes a shape of a blob-like amalgamation of all feral aliens, that were brought to Earth essentially by 'Alliance' for them to experiment on. Inhravtidius carapace on in the center of it along with a pincer in the place of it's left arm. Yengnutrium wings, protruding from it's back along with a razor sharp serrated claw in the place of it's right arm. Ulniviunite slime oozing from it along with multiple lamprey-type mouths from which long, whip-like spiked tongues are stretching. Ezrondium arachnid legs, incredibly sharp, piercing floor as it moves. Tentacles, emerging from various parts of it's body essentially. Unlike other beasts, this one is in particular rage, as if it was made for hunting. It is bigger, faster compared to other beasts, seems to be trained as an experimental soldier. It holds a strange organic-looking gun in one of it's tentacles",
