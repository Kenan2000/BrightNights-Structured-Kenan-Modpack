I've learned a lot from our female mentor, she has shown me her personal projects, hidden from authorities, beneficial drugs, not just symbiote weapons. One of them restores all of our hormones to normal levels. We've developed forbidden affection, love, got lost in it but we were happy.\n \n    One of our authorities suspects 'unsanctioned experiments', frames my mentor, she gets killed, my own people destroy all of trust I had for them. Years after, I'm an experienced scientist. This fucktard confronts me, tells me I should be grateful he didn't frame me. I tell him all I think about him. We fight, he forcefully injects me with an experimental symbiote. I brutally smash fuckard into a pulp with my tentacle hammers. I escape via 'Alliance' portal to Earth, then I disguise as a human, I try to help a friendly organization to rebuild. Search for love, tell 'fuck off' to everyone else who prevents you from doing so. Find him or her. Be happy. I still search for my love with hope as well",

Just can't trust everyone, I'm essentially an exile to my own race, yet also one of the alien invaders to humans. Wanzeltiums with me have developed a unique technology: Energy Shield Generators that create a gigantic energy field based on sources that we've found on our planets. This field can protect people from horrors of Cataclysm, keeping even 'Alliance' militia away, shields are this strong.\n \n    Luckily, I've stolen blueprints, with me being responsible for most of this technology, they won't be able to replicate it any time soon. Still, version that I have built lacks generator amplifiers. This shield will only protect us if we install all of these amplifiers to my experimental Shield Generator. Not even mentioning need to salvage more of their tech to get more power cells to make multiple Shield Generators. If Ulysses' child, Subject5, is clever enough with putting intel or journals, armed survivors may help us to cleanse all of these areas that I've marked on this map in exactly this order.

Small city, in the middle of nowhere, perfect place to conduct experiments. Hidden laboratory, unsanctioned bioweapons experiments going wrong, population turning into aggressive mutants, city being nuked from the face of Earth essentially. Many evacuated, not witnessing anything, luckily for them.

What she went through, what she found, what she saw in That City though was even more interesting. Diary of main scientist with proof of one of his samples being stolen from him by military men. Highly trained female infiltrator searching for something in laboratory.

That scum we thought we had killed in that mansion was cunning, devious, just like that woman who changed God knows how many employers. Organization's founder, that was behind events of that mansion along with That City, was no less of a mad man. The more ambitious they were, the more fucked up their ideas were. Some wanted regional power, some wanted riches, some wanted World domination, whereas some were so fucked up in terms of their ideas that I'm glad we've killed them.\n \n   Him and his superiors had a simple plan. First, retrieve whatever of their horrible work they left there, then leave no witnesses thanks to their bio-soldiers hunters, then let government do their job of nuking city so that nobody would know of this. These bastards' arrogance, huh? No way, motherfuckers. Not only me with some good people have escaped safely, we have also managed to destroy a lot of these bio-soldiers with all of these hunters. I've acquired plenty of intel to learn that fucker from that mansion was alive, plotting to continue work of his superiors. He later killed them, betrayed everyone he knew.\n \n    I can tell you more, there were bioweapons with all kinds of private mutants armies in many parts of the World essentially.

Clearly, Cataclysm happened, however, our training, our experience, our stubbornness really saved our asses.

Special safezones located across the entire World for agents from various countries. Back then, 4 of us were stationed in North America. This includes me, my partner, also my sister along with her police officer survivor, hah. They became a couple, their first 'survivors date' taught them how to care for each other real good.\n \n   My partner wants us to stay here, to help local survivor structures with more mundane stuff that requires more concentration. Clearing local areas, handling logistics, making safe routes, expanding survivors' structures, helping find safe sources of water. Forget about secret vile organizations, eh? That's what younger professionals are for, right? My sister with her police officer promoted to a government agent, so, leave this shit for them to investigate?\n \n    Maybe she is right, we need to care for each other, settle down together, help local survivors, ensure our own safety hopefully. We should also convince our couple of adventurers to do the same. Maybe not. No, not now. Cults, 'THEY', 'True Superiors', this fucker is still out there. Unless we get help from survivors.

All 4 of us should be thankful that we have even managed to survive, assemble our team again. With intel that we've learned about strange organizations' activities in New England, no doubt that bio-soldiers, mutants are again being produced by shady masterminds. The most prominent are Strange Cult, 'THEY', there are also rumors of a more discreet organization called 'True Superiors'. Considering how careful 'Alliance' is, sheer numbers of these bio-soldiers, all of this made aliens choose a safe option of allying with them.\n \n    Still, they are much weaker than pre-Cataclysm private military organizations, they are simply remnants of former ones. However, they are way too sophisticated for mere remnants. I know some altruistic remnants of organizations, they are quite advanced, but are still forced into hiding. They even rely on help from local survivors. I'm not sure if we should concentrate on restoring safety in our local areas like professional survivors, or support my partner's obsession with further investigating these ourselves, I'm confused honestly.\n \n    What I know from our allies is that survivors do fend off these bastards successfully, they even attack their structures. Even though my distrust towards these experiments is greatest compared to all of us, these scientists have shown me proof of saving survivors from dangers of The Blob, Mycus, Triffids. Clearly, BL9 is a symbiote, it's origin is not of regular bioweapons. Only because it is either easily modifiable BL9 or horrible mutations from The Blob from local water, BL9 has a potential to be safe option to protect everyone, but only provided that experiments are long-term, guarantee physical, mental safety of hosts hopefully as well",

Ah, shit, reminds me of so much we've went through with her. Two desperate survivors in these horrible conditions stuck in a city full of terrors. Love was least of my priorities back then. I worked as a police officer in my home town. As I remember, this started with me receiving my promotion of a corporal under the condition that I would move to a nearby town. I needed money, so I agreed. It was That City, one of the most horrible pre-Cataclysm cases of unsanctioned bioweapons experiments.\n \n    I was about to start my first day as a newly promoted corporal. I was being late when I've heard the sirens all across the city, evacuation helicopters recklessly getting away. On my way to police station I saw people aggressively chasing other people, leaping at them, grabbing them by their legs. They clawed them savagely then started to eat their flesh. It was horrifying and disgusting, I puked upon seeing this right in my car. Some of them saw me and ran towards my car, I pressed gas, running few of them over. I made my way to one of the closest relatively big markets.\n \n    I went to this market get supplies, also to possibly find a good melee weapon, a fire axe or a wrench. I heard a running noise from the outside towards the same door I entered. A girl armed with a revolver clumsily yet quickly entered with a shambler behind her. I aimed at it, telling her to get down. With a headshot I killed it. Then we both ran towards my car, quickly made our way out of there. She was a junior robotics engineering student in That City. Her brother was a high-ranking veteran policeman. This explained to me her being pretty good with guns",

    "description": "This really is a cheap romance novel name! Though, I actually find it funny. I was getting a robotics engineering degree in my university. I always found applied math, physics pretty fun. My brother, the cop in our family, approved of my decision, he is all fists and fighting, so analytical one in our family is a must. As my dear says about his first day of corporal rank experience, I felt the same way back then. Love, no. Safety, protection, yes. That's how I felt back then. My brother was missing, I was alone on the streets, searching for him, when the whole city went to shit. I ran as fast as I could to nearest building, coming across him. A guy in a police uniform, aiming his gun at me, telling me to get down. So I did, out of fear, yet he killed a shambler behind me.\n \n    We made our way in his car to police station, which, disappointingly, was also infested with these mutants. Most were shamblers, but there was this horrible type. A fleshy beast with a grotesque head, long tongue, no eyes, and long claws size of a human. We were chased by a giant brute in this building. As we were hiding from it, I found documents proving that my brother left That City weeks ago to do his private investigation. Also we found a secret underground passage in That City's police station. It was leading to some kind of a laboratory complex, which answered most of our questions in terms of what the heck even happened in That City.\n \n    This entire lab was a huge conspiracy. Unsanctioned bioweapons experiments. An incident with bioweapon leak was a result of lab's main mutated scientist going mad over his secret creation being stolen by some private military. On our way out of lab, we saved this scientist's daughter. Three of us barely made it out of there safely via an underground train system with that scientist beast and a huge brute chasing us",

That's what her father told her when injecting her with all kinds of shit. Her bruises were healing up at an extreme rate. The whole shit was really a conspiracy with shady people involved. This is what government told me later on. Hunter brute, horribly mutated scientist, stolen samples of bioweapons, shady female spy. That spy really did save my life multiple times, helping me to destroy this brute, but she clearly had her own motives there. Every time our paths crossed, I always knew that she had some errands to do, provided by her new employers. Whatever, we made it safe, now about events after That City essentially.\n \n    Let's just say that government has become interested in two barely trained survivors going through so much shit successfully. We've been 'offered' government agents jobs. Not much choice, considering what we've seen. Then these were times of my duty in various parts of the World. Strangely, current New England prominent factions of madmen that are obsessed with BL9 symbiote really remind me of what I've seen in Europe. Is that some kind of a bullshit trend? As years went by, I tried to convince my engineer girl to let me talk government out of her further involvement. I've been seeing more and more shit that I didn't get killed for only because I'm too useful to kill essentially.\n \n    Honey is too stubborn, she wanted to delve even deeper into this. Saving people from madmen with bioweapons is more important than building complex electromechanical systems. That's what she says. When Cataclysm happened, this tight grip was gone.

We've travelled across the World, fought madmen along with their creations. My dear warned me though that eventually we can uncover things that will make government treat us differently. I convinced him though that our usefulness simply matters much more to them than our knowledge, as long as we have no objections to working for them. Then Cataclysm happened. Governments were gone. No united control. Only individual organizations remained. Some new, some remnants of former organizations. All have different motives.\n \n    Even though there is a lot of work we have in terms of rebuilding everything, I've convinced my dear for us to become hunters of some sorts. We investigate activities of strange local cults, military formations. If we suspect them to have not particularly friendly motives, we carefully check their structures. Usually they clearly are hostile, attack everyone on sight, however some really are altruistic. Latter are much more discreet, not because it is their intention. They achieve their goals only by communicating with, helping people. They are forced into hiding, especially in New England area because of Strange Cults, 'THEM', 'True Superiors', 'Alliance'. Should not we help them to fend them off to keep everyone safe?\n \n    They all diligently hunt for BL9, all of these bastards. Even altruistic organizations that we've contacted convince us of BL9 not being a bioweapon, huh? I mean, pretty much everything around, The Blob, Mycus, Triffids, can be considered bioweapons, pretty much not safe for majority of people. BL9, as our allies state, can be modified, to be used as protection against other hostile microorganisms, they even have proof of this. I don't know, my brother would not agree, but if there are no alternative options. This potentially can be used as means to protect all of us, our offspring, hopefully as well",

Has he done something significant in his life with this way of thinking? Maybe. Maybe not. What I know is that his advice greatly helps me in my work. My work is not just means of acquiring money. It helps me to prevent people who think in absolutes from shaping the World in a way that they like. This is especially important if we are talking about genetical experiments related to unknown microorganisms which have many uses. From healthy drugs, protection, extending lives of people to bioweapons. Don't ask me how I got in this field of work. Let's just say that I have received plenty of military experience to work as a professional mercenary spy.\n \n    I've heard of reputation of organization behind incidents in that mansion along with That City. No doubt that extremists were among it's leaders, intending to work on advanced bioweapons research. I was offered a job by an unknown man, who described himself as a former research scientist in that organization, who had changed his ways. My job was to intercept military, sent by that organization to kill their main scientist, stationed in That City's laboratory. My goal was not to save that scientist. Like I was told, scum simply wanted to sell property of their organization to highest bidder essentially. My task was to steal this property from military then bring it to my employer.\n \n    As a careful person I am, I waited for a perfect opportunity to ambush them. However, my stealth approach was interrupted by hordes of mutants, attacking both me along with military. The whole city went to shit within a few minutes. I had to run for my life essentially. However, I am no dumb girl. I knew that lab must have contained various intelligence, notes, diaries, maybe even something more important. This scientist devoted himself to his work entirely. There must have been another sample in that laboratory. I managed to find both, though, it was very difficult to do based on what I've seen there honestly",

    "description": "Essentially in my work thinking in absolutes means either of two things. Either granting access to all of these drugs, genetically modified microorganisms, to general public. Giving them all for free. Not thinking that this can produce riots, forced acceleration of production. At the same time, similar inadequate total access can make available production of bioweapons for madmen. Both are extremists points of views that must be avoided. This is what gave me motivation when I was going through that ruined city. I trusted this man. He seemed like he was hating himself for his involvement in this mess. All he needed, he said, was to make sure that their property won't get into their hands. Incident in that mansion fooled me into trusting him.\n \n    I've found very important intelligence in police station, records of a former member of investigation department that almost got investigators' team killed in that mansion. It was said that man was incredibly devious, cunning. It's as if his betrayal was planned in advance. Whoever wrote this had suspicions of involvement of this organization in an attempted murder of investigators' team. This made me think of who I actually work for. However, there was no real proof of whether it was the same person or not. In the same police station I've met a newly promoted corporal, pretty young, seemed to lack experience, still, confident in a non-arrogant way, determined to survive, also escape to safety with whatever companion of his that he mentioned.\n \n    I saved his ass from one of hunters bioweapons sent to kill any witnesses. Hah, he was keep asking me questions. I tried to buzz him off saying that he should be glad that not only I didn't kill him, but also saved his ass multiple times as well. I didn't know that we would meet in Europe with him again. Well, I did steal a sample from him. Still, I knew by then who I worked for, sending him fake sample as a reward. What do I do now after Cataclysm? Well, I've recently brought an advanced BL9 sample to human disguised exiled alien scientist that helps humans survive",

Majority of them are either dumb mutants, used for killing, or power hungry fools, obsessed with domination of local areas. They don't even care about improving living conditions for their own people. However, there are a few human scientists, who have told me about their most experienced scientist. It is the leader of 'True Superiors' organization at the same time essentially. Humans are feeble, mostly are worthless. But not this man. Even I, representative of a superior race, fear this man. It's like he is not even a man at this point. So what they said is that on their Militarized Island, with instructions made by this man, they developed a Super Soldier.\n \n    I came to Militarized Island to see quality of their work. It was pretty good, still, lacking many features that we could add. It was obviously a carefully made humanoid amalgamation of mutated animals that each of our 'Alliance' races brought here. Later when I wanted to talk with these scientists about our own, Davranides' projects, they told me that this man knows that I was one of the few Davranides scientists who showed interest in Super Soldier Project. Scientists said that this man insists that we enhance this project further. I said that I am not sure, but scientists simply replied. They said that Davranides will take on this work if 'Alliance' as a whole values their safety on Earth essentially. We don't want to make enemies out of our allies. We continued this project ourselves. Enhanced versions can be found in various impact sites Cave Systems, whereas experimental enhanced versions can be found in our own Mobile Bases.",
