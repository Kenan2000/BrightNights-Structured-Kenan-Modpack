The Cartel was trying to launder their drug and human trafficking money by building a large indoor go-cart race track.  Somehow the CIA had an agent within the that specific cartel and were able to influence the cartel to invest far more money than they should have, after which the FBI collected all the bad guys they had this building practically ready to open.  The FBI ended up giving most of the floors to the Library of Congress to store newspapers, and some of the other usual suspects took their share too.  Once this cataclysm happened and much of the government was destroyed, this site was commandeered to coordinate local responses against the Xenoids."
