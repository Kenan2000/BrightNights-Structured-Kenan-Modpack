    "description": "Humanoid giant grotesque amalgamation of all feral aliens, that were brought to Earth essentially by 'Alliance' for them to experiment on. Inhravtidius carapace on it's torso along with a pincer in the place of it's left arm. Yengnutrium wings, protruding from it's back along with a razor sharp serrated claw in the place of it's right arm. Ulniviunite slime on it's torso along with a lamprey-type mouth from which a long, whip-like spiked tongue is stretching. Ezrondium arachnid legs, incredibly sharp, piercing floor as it moves. Tentacles, emerging from various parts of it's body essentially. Unlike other beasts, this one is in particular rage, as if it was made for hunting. It is bigger, faster compared to other beasts, seems to be trained as an experimental soldier. It holds a strange organic-looking gun in one of it's tentacles",
