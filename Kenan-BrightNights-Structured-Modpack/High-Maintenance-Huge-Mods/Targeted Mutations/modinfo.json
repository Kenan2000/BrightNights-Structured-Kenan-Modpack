    "description": "Adds the ability to make serums that will give you one specific mutation, as well as introducing a recipe for making the targeted purifier. I've chosen to only give a few bad mutations targeted mutation serums, as anyone using this likely wants to avoid bad mutations like the plague. Does not support mutations added by other mods, but it's not hard for modders to add the same sort of thing to their own mod. Post-threshold mutations still require you to be past its respective threshold, and if you're capable of reaching the mutation but it's several layers of mutations away you might not get there in one shot. If used and nothing happens or you get the yearning to be free message then it means you cannot get it currently or it is post-threshold. If you want to pass a threshold without risk of other mutations there are serums for that too but you'll need enough mutations in that line to pass it regardless. For an easier time of getting the mutations required to pass a threshold or get more advanced mutations, consult the wiki's mutations page. Compatibility with other mods that modify vanilla mutations is unlikely. As a little bonus I've snuck in an ability for some wings that didn't before to slow your fall to safe levels like the bird wings after activating them, which includes the bat, butterfly, and insect wings.",
