    "description": "Adds new Xeno-Adapted Stuff. Close to hi-tech content. Includes an armor set (slightly better protection than survival armor, less encumbrance), a new knife (better butchering, impression damage) and a vortex bag (120 L, tiny size, no encumbrance). Craft recipes are in vanilla lab journal. High price in terms of money. Late game content!",
