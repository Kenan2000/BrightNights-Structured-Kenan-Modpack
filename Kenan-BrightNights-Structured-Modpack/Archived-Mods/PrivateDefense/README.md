# What

Private Defense (`private_defense`) is a [*Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*](http://github.com/cleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA) mod that adds 3D-printable plastic firearms into the game. 

It depends on the base game (`dda`) and [Homestead Instruments Inc.](https://github.com/FirebrandCoding/HomesteadInstrumentsInc) (`homestead`).

# Why

3D-printed weapons are sadly overlooked in the base game, despite being an important modern method of decentralized manufacturing. This mod seeks to alleviate that.

Also, I was dared to play without using anything made of iron or iron alloys (the so-called "Fey run").

# Lore

Private Defense was an anonymous group of firearms designers specializing in 3D-printed firearms. Operating in the Dark Web, they're considered responsible for disseminating the CAD files for plastic firearms.

Given that their blueprints actively disregard several copyrights, Private Defense and their work has been under intense scrutiny for several years prior to the Cataclysm. Despite the efforts, however, the group remained uncaught. The CAD files, having been taken down off clearnet, continued to circulate among the Second Amendment advocates in secrecy.

It's been theorized that Private Defense either had been previously or remained members of the US intelligence community at the time of the publishing of the blueprints. The extremely-small digital trail left behind by the members of the initiative seems to indicate that the group has had an extensive experience operating on the Web.
